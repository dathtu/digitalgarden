I’ll borrow a definition from Steph Ango, CEO of Obsidian, on the _file over app_ philosophy:

> _File over app_ is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.

One of the reasons I love Obsidian is that it stores all my notes locally on my device. Every note is a standalone file, giving me complete ownership and control over my data. I can save them anywhere, use them with any other app, and never worry about being locked into a single platform. This perfectly aligns with what Steph Ango said:

> In the fullness of time, the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

In the highly unlikely (and utterly terrifying) event that I wake up to find Obsidian has shut down overnight, I won’t panic—because my notes are still mine. No subscriptions, no proprietary formats, no hostage situation. Just me and my files, exactly as they should be.
