I believe less is more, so I keep note-taking effortless—because the easier it is, the more I actually write. Here is how I start a note:
1. Open [[Why Obsidian\|Obsidian]] on my laptop and create a new note.
2. Insert my note template with the standard frontmatter.
3. Write the note I want.
4. Open Digital Garden Centre to publish the note.
5. The note file will be push to my GitHub and then Netlify will re-formatted to html for this site.
6. Profit! 

This setup takes a bit of effort, but once it’s done, I can write, edit, and publish notes live right from inside Obsidian. So it can be done from my laptop, iPad or even my phone.
