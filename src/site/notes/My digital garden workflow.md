## The writing app of choice - Obsidian 
I am oriented toward performance and laziness in almost every aspects of life. After trying many writing apps and solutions, I find [Obsidian](obsidian.md) is the best note taking app for the following reason:
- It uses markdown language to write
- full control of my notes files so I can publish using a plugin 
- can do from any device like a laptop, phone or iPad with just Obsidian app. 
## My note-taking workflow for this garden
I use Obsidian, GitHub and Netlify to publish the notes, the workflow is simple:
1. Open Obsidian on my laptop and start a new note.
2. Insert a template for note that I've created to save time 
3. Write the note using markdown. 
4. Send command publish to send it live to this site. 
5. The note is ready and live to this digital garden. 

My workflow is simple but requires technical setup. I might create a guide on how I set this up in the future. I will put a link here when it's ready.
