About six months ago, I was on the hunt for a NAS (Network-Attached Storage) solution to back up all my camera photos. Like many people, I wanted to ditch unnecessary subscriptions and take full control of my data.

I started with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a tiny, credit card-sized computer that can handle all sorts of DIY projects. It cost me around A$120 to get all the necessary hardware, and I installed [CasaOS](https://www.casaos.io/) as the operating system. CasaOS is a simple, user-friendly solution, perfect for non-techies (and lazy techies like me).

With everything set up, I had a fully functional NAS! I could back up my documents, files, and photos while accessing them from any device on my network. CasaOS even has a built-in app store, making it ridiculously easy to install apps with just one click. 

Naturally, I installed [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) to test the streaming capabilities of my tiny NAS, and to my surpriseâ€”it worked like a charm as long as the video is FHD and no transcoding needed (direct streaming).
