I will borrow the CEO of Obsidian, Steph Ango, the definition of *file over app* as below:
> *File over app* is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom. 

One of the reasons I like Obsidian is that it stores all my notes locally on my device. This is important because each file is a note of information and I have full control of ownership over my data. I can save them anywhere I want or use them with any other apps. It resonates with what Steph Ango said:
>In the fullness of time, the files you create are more important than the tools you use to create them. Apps are ephemeral, but your files have a chance to last.

In the highly unlikely (and utterly terrifying) scenario where I wake up to find Obsidian shut down, I won’t panic—because my notes are still mine.
