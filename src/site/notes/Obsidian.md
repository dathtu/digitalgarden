After trying many note-taking apps and writing solutions, I find [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) is the best note-taking app for the following reasons:
- it has [[File over app\|file over app]] philosophy in mind, all notes are in markdown files, allow me to use them with any other app or back up to any cloud service of my choice, I currently back up all notes to my Dropbox cloud storage.
- it's available for free in all platforms including Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS. 
- it is amazingly fast and simple yet has powerful community where I can use download plugins to customize the look of my vault.
