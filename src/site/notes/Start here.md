Hello world! Welcome to my digital garden written from Obsidian app. 
# Things I'm working on this garden:
- take more notes to build my knowledge
- make it easy to navigate in a non-linear way
- create a how-to-use for this website 

# Tools I used to take notes:
- Obsidian - the best note taking app ever created (to me)
