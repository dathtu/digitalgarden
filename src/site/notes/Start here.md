Hello world!
Welcome to my digital garden published by Obsidian app. 

# What this place is
A place to capture and store relevant notes, thoughts, ideas, quotes, project notes, information and knowledge I want to hold onto. 
It's a personal wiki where I continue to improve the notes over time. So yes, it is a work-in-progress wiki. 
# What this place is not
A blog with refined posts, excellent writing skills, regularly updated.
# Things I'm working on
- ==take more notes to grow this garden 🌳== 
- ==create a map of content (MOC) 🗺️==
- ==create a dark mode button  🦉==
