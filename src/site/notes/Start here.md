Welcome to my digital garden published by [[Why Obsidian\|Obsidian]] app. 
# What this place is
A place to capture and store relevant notes, thoughts, ideas, quotes, project notes, information and knowledge I want to hold onto. 
It's a personal wiki where I continue to improve the notes over time. So yes, it is a work-in-progress wiki. 
# What this place is not
A blog with refined posts, excellent writing skills, regularly updated.
# Things I'm working on
- take more notes to grow this garden üå≥
- create a map of content (MOC) üó∫Ô∏è
- create a dark mode button  ü¶â
