==Hello world!== Welcome to my digital garden published by Obsidian app. 

## What this place is
A place to capture and store relevant notes, thoughts, ideas, quotes, project notes, information and knowledge I want to hold onto. 
It's a personal wiki where I continue to improve the notes over time. I will try to link the notes where it makes sense to do it. 
## What this place is not
A blog with refined posts, excellent writing skills, regularly updated.
## Things I'm working on
- take more notes to grow this garden 🌳, be a good gardener 🧑🏼‍🌾. 
- create a map of content to navigate and explore 🗺️
- change the appearance 🎨
- create a dark mode toggle for 🦉 reader
